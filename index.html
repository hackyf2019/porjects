        <p class="paragraph">There are lots of different food recipes in this page. I like to travel a lot around the World and discover different food types of each culture. Some food types are very spicy and some are very strange even to taste a bit. Some food types might be accepted as bad and disgusting while some people find them very <strong>delicious.</strong> It is very common to eat <em>insects</em> in far east while it is totaly awkward in some cultures.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Eating meat is very common in most of arabian countries while vegetable is more preferred in most european cultures. <em>Cat, dog, or snake</em> are eatable in some countries.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">There are some countries that fruits are part of daily eating more than meat and vegetables. Because fruit industry is developed very well and the prices of all fruit types is quite cheap. Some fruits might also contain more benefits for <strong>human health.</strong>
